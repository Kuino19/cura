## Vercel Web Analytics Installation

Successfully installed and configured Vercel Web Analytics for this Next.js App Router project.

### Changes Made:

#### 1. Installed Package
- Added `@vercel/analytics@^1.6.1` to dependencies using npm
- Updated package-lock.json with new dependencies

#### 2. Modified Files
- **src/app/layout.tsx**
  - Added import: `import { Analytics } from "@vercel/analytics/next"`
  - Added `<Analytics />` component inside the `<body>` tag after `{children}`
  - Follows Next.js App Router best practices for root layout integration

#### 3. Build Verification
- Successfully ran `npm run build` to verify the implementation
- Build completed without errors related to Analytics
- Fixed pre-existing build issue with native binaries by performing clean reinstall
- No linting errors introduced by the Analytics changes

### Implementation Details:

The project uses:
- **Router Type**: App Router (app directory)
- **Package Manager**: npm (package-lock.json)
- **Root Layout**: src/app/layout.tsx

The Analytics component was added to the root layout file, which ensures it's loaded on every page of the application. This is the recommended approach for App Router projects according to Vercel's documentation.

### Additional Notes:

- The Analytics component is client-side only and won't affect server-side rendering
- No environment variables are required for basic analytics functionality
- Analytics will automatically start tracking page views once deployed to Vercel
- All existing code structure and formatting has been preserved
